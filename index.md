## What's Kedge?

Kedge is a simple, easy and declarative way to define and deploy applications to Kubernetes by writing very concise application definitions.

Why do people love Kedge?

  - __Declarative:__ Declarative definitions specifying developer's intent.
  - __Simplicity:__ Using a simple and concise specification that is easy to understand and define.
  - __Concise:__ Define just the necessary bits and Kedge will do the rest. Kedge will interprolate and pick the best defaults for your application to run on Kubernetes.
  - __Multi-container environments:__ Define your containers, services and applications in one simple file, or split them into multiple files.
  - __Familiar structure:__ Using a familiar YAML structure as Kubernetes, it's easy to pick-up and understand Kedge.
  - __Built on top of Kubernetes Pod definition:__ Leverages Kuberenetes Pod definition (PodSpec) and avoids leaky abstractions.
