## Comparison to other projects

You must be wondering why this project when we have other projects to do the same
the answer to that is below:

#### Compared with OpenCompose

* No new language invented, using Kubernetes structs.
* Saves from inventing leaky abstractions.
* Someone defining apps here would find it easier in the world of Kubernetes.
* OpenCompose adds it's own abstractions which is new thing someone needs to
learn, while this approach keeps user near to Kubernetes.
* Also for every new feature a user needs to use she has to rely on OpenCompose
developers to add it to the tool and language, while this approach gives lot of
functionality out of the box.

#### Compared with Kubernetes artifacts

* No need to define everything that Kubernetes needs, define necessary things
and other things will be assumed as defaults by the tool.
* User can choose to define minimum required essentials or define
each and everything by herself.

## TODOs (Road to 0.1.0)

* [ ] Parameterize the ingress host value or endpoint value
* [ ] Rename persistentVolumes to something better like volumeClaims
* [ ] Add support for Jobs, CronJobs, HorizontalPodAutoScaler, etc.
* [ ] Comprehensive documentation of each and every feature
* [ ] The way secrets and configmaps are referred in containers.env it is too much indirection, making it easier.
* [ ] configData are confusing terms rename them.
* [ ] Add convenient shortcuts to the make configMapKeyRef and secretKeyRef usage becomes easier.
* [ ] Add such shortcuts to other part of the spec, but user can choose to use shortcuts or define everything without having to use shortcuts.
* [ ] Create intelligent defaults to the tool, to reduce what a user will write.
* [ ] Generate OpenShift artifacts? All things related to OpenShift like builds, routes, etc.
* [ ] Fields could be renamed to have easier or better name.
